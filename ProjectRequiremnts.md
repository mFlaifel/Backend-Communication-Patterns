Backend Communication Patterns Project: Food Delivery Platform
Project Overview
You've completed learning about various backend communication patterns. Now you must apply this knowledge to solve real business problems. Your task is to analyze requirements and choose the most appropriate communication pattern for each feature.

Scenario: You're a backend engineer at FoodFast, a growing food delivery startup.
The CTO has given you various features to implement, but you must decide which communication pattern to use for each one based on business requirements and technical constraints.

Business Case: FoodFast - Food Delivery Platform
Company Background
FoodFast is a food delivery platform serving 10,000 active users across 5 cities. They're experiencing rapid growth and need to implement new features to stay competitive. The platform connects customers, restaurants, and delivery drivers through a mobile app and web interface.

Your Challenge
The product team has identified several features that need backend implementation. However, they haven't specified how to implement them - that's your job as the backend engineer. You must analyze each requirement and choose the most appropriate communication pattern.

Feature Requirements (You Must Choose the Pattern)
Feature 1: Customer Account Management
Business Requirement: Customers need to register, login, update their profile information, and manage payment methods.
Key Details:

Users expect immediate confirmation when they log in.

Profile updates should be reflected immediately.

Payment information must be secure and reliable.

System should work reliably even with a poor internet connection.
Your Task: Choose the appropriate communication pattern and justify your decision.

Feature 2: Order Tracking for Customers
Business Requirement: Once a customer places an order, they want to track its status from "restaurant preparing" to "delivered."
Key Details:

Order status changes: Confirmed → Preparing → Ready → Picked up → Delivered.

Customers check status frequently (every 30 seconds to 2 minutes).

The mobile app should conserve battery life.

Status updates should feel "real-time" but don't need to be instant.

The system has 1000+ concurrent users during peak hours.
Your Task: Analyze this requirement and choose the best communication pattern. Consider mobile battery usage and server load.

Feature 3: Driver Location Updates
Business Requirement: Customers want to see their delivery driver's location on a map in real-time while the order is being delivered.
Key Details:

Driver location updates every 10-15 seconds.

Only the customer who placed the order should see the driver's location.

Location should appear smooth on the map.

The feature is only active during delivery (30-45 minutes max).

Needs to work on mobile networks with varying quality.
Your Task: Choose the pattern that provides the best user experience while being efficient.

Feature 4: Restaurant Order Notifications
Business Requirement: When a customer places an order, the restaurant needs to be notified immediately. Restaurant staff should see new orders appear on their dashboard without refreshing.
Key Details:

Restaurants must receive orders instantly (within 5 seconds).

Orders should appear automatically on the restaurant dashboard.

The restaurant might have multiple staff members logged in.

During busy hours, restaurants receive 1-2 orders per minute.

Missed orders result in unhappy customers and lost revenue.
Your Task: Select the pattern that ensures reliable, fast order delivery to restaurants.

Feature 5: Customer Support Chat
Business Requirement: Customers need to chat with support agents for help with orders, refunds, and general questions.
Key Details:

Messages should appear instantly for both customer and agent.

Support agents handle 5-10 chat conversations simultaneously.

Customers expect immediate responses like WhatsApp/Messenger.

Chat history should be preserved.

The system needs typing indicators and message delivery confirmations.
Your Task: Choose the pattern that provides the best chat experience.

Feature 6: System-Wide Announcements
Business Requirement: The platform needs to send announcements to all users about service outages, new features, or promotional offers.
Key Details:

Announcements go to thousands of users simultaneously.

Users should receive announcements while using the app.

Announcements are not critical (can be delayed by a few minutes).

Should not overwhelm the server during peak usage.

Users might not be actively using the app when the announcement is sent.
Your Task: Choose an efficient pattern for broadcasting messages to many users.

Feature 7: Image Upload for Menu Items
Business Requirement: Restaurants need to upload photos of their menu items. The system should show upload progress and notify when processing is complete.
Key Details:

Image files are 2-10MB in size.

Processing includes resizing, compression, and quality checks.

Processing takes 30 seconds to 3 minutes depending on file size.

Restaurant managers want to know when they can publish the menu item.

Upload might fail due to network issues or file problems.
Your Task: Choose the pattern for handling file uploads and status updates.

Project Deliverables

1. Implementation Code (60% of grade)
   For each feature, you must:

Implement your chosen communication pattern.

Include working code demonstrating the pattern.

Use only free, open-source technologies.

Provide clear setup instructions.

2. Decision Report (40% of grade)
   For each feature, document:

Pattern Choice: Which communication pattern you chose.

Reasoning: Why this pattern is optimal for the specific requirements.

Trade-offs: What you sacrificed and what you gained.

Alternatives Considered: Other patterns you evaluated and why you rejected them.

Implementation Details: How you handled edge cases and errors.

Sample Decision Framework
For each feature, consider:

Business Impact Questions
How critical is immediate delivery?

What happens if the feature is delayed or fails?

How many users are affected simultaneously?

What's the user experience expectation?

Technical Constraint Questions
How much server load can we handle?

What are the network reliability requirements?

How does this affect mobile battery life?

What's the acceptable latency?

Example Analysis Format
Feature: [Feature Name]
Pattern Chosen: [Your Choice]
Reasoning:

Business requirement analysis: [Why this matters to business]

Technical considerations: [Server load, latency, reliability needs]

User experience impact: [How this affects end users]

Scalability factors: [How this performs under load]
Alternatives considered:

[Pattern A]: Rejected because [specific reason]

[Pattern B]: Rejected because [specific reason]
Trade-offs accepted: [What you're sacrificing for your choice]

Success Tips
Think Like a Business Owner: Consider cost, reliability, and user experience.

Start Simple: Don't over-engineer solutions.

Test Realistically: Use multiple browser tabs to simulate concurrent users.

Document Decisions: Keep notes on why you chose each pattern.

Consider Edge Cases: What happens when networks are slow or connections drop?

Plan for Scale: How would your solution handle 10x more users?

Common Decision Patterns
Critical, immediate responses → Request/Response

Status checking with delays acceptable → Short Polling

Real-time feel without true real-time needs → Long Polling

One-way server updates → Server-Sent Events

Interactive, bi-directional communication → WebSockets

Decoupled, event-driven architecture → Pub/Sub

Remember: There's no single "correct" answer for most features. Your job is to make informed decisions and justify them clearly. Real-world engineering is about trade-offs, constraints, and business priorities - not perfect theoretical solutions.
